# Tool to identify transmembrane helices in tertiary structures

Transmembrane proteins play a vital role in living cells by allowing communication and transport
between the cell and the outside environment. Due to their role in a vast number of physiological
processes, membrane proteins are the most popular class of drug targets. Therefore distinguishing
whether a protein is transmembrane or not is an important scientific question.
At large, the primary, secondary and tertiary structure of transmembrane proteins show certain
differences to those of soluble, globular proteins. Due to the lipid bilayer transmembrane domains
are embedded in, these segments typically consist of apolar residues, have stable secondary
structures across the membrane, which in the case of helical transmembrane segments, are
oriented perpendicular to the membrane plane.
The implemented tool is a classifier which, given a PDB structure, is able to determine
whether it is of an alpha-helical transmembrane protein, and if so, identify the approximate
membrane plane and the transmembrane helices.
